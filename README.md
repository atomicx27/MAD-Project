# Location Alarm Clock

A smart alarm clock that alerts you based on a specific location or time. The alarm rings either when you reach a predefined location or at a set time, giving you optional directions to your target destination.

## Features

- **Location-Based Alarms**: Set alarms that trigger when you arrive at a particular location.
- **Time-Based Alarms**: Set alarms to ring at a specified time, just like a traditional alarm.
- **Navigation Directions**: Get directions to your specified location directly after the alarm rings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple to set up and manage alarms.

## Project Overview

The Location Alarm Clock is designed for users who need timely reminders upon reaching specific places, such as offices, schools, or meeting points. The app detects your arrival at the set location and triggers an alarm, or alternatively, rings at a set time to remind you of an event.

## How It Works

1. **Set Location and Time**: Define a target location or choose a specific time for the alarm.
2. **Automatic Triggering**: The app continuously monitors your location. When you arrive at the set location (or at the defined time), the alarm will go off.
3. **Get Directions**: Optionally, follow provided directions to your destination from the alarm.

## Usage

1. **Open the App**: Launch the Location Alarm Clock on your device.
2. **Set Alarm**: Choose between a time-based or location-based alarm.
3. **Enable Permissions**: Allow the app to access your location for location-based alarms.
4. **Trigger Alarm**: The alarm will ring based on your set criteria, and youâ€™ll receive directions if chosen.

## Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: Android.
- **Dependencies**: Any required modules or APIs, such as Google Maps API, for location tracking and directions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Custom Ringtones**: Set unique ringtones for different alarms.
- **Snooze Functionality**: Allow users to snooze location-based alarms.
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimize location polling to save battery life.
